This is the code book for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

Starting from the top:

x_test, y_test, x_train, and y_train are the data read in from the provided data set separated.
combined_x and combined_y are the row bound combined data of x_train, x_test and the same for the y versions.
combined is the column bound of combined_x and combined_y.
col_names stores the coloumn names from the data set.
colnames(combined) is the transpose of the second column of col_names.
sub_test, sub_train are the read in values of subject_test in the data set.
sub_total is the sub_test and sub_train bound together.
activity_labels are the read in activity labels from the data set.
std_row is the standard deviation of read in data values for colnames(combined).
mean_row is teh mean of the read in data values for colnames(combined).
meanFreq_cols is the count of the frequency that means occur.
data is the new data set with all the above calculations.
tidydata is there to set up the matrix for our tidy data set.
subjects are the values 1 through 30.
we assign the two coloumn names in the data to be subjects and activities.
false is the subsetted data wanted for this analysis.
vector is the mean of this data.
new_vector is the new vector with the above calculations.
tidydata is where this is stored.
The names of the tidydata is replaced with the new names.
it is wrote to the TidyDataWAverages.txt file.
