# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This Repository provides a link for R-Studio code for extracting and merging data from 4 different data sets.

Specifically the run.anaylsis.R performed the following steps:
  1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject from the ocmbined data set with names created above.
  
The more specific steps of the code are placed in the file as comments.
